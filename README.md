# Teensy-Stickless-Controller

This sketch REQUIRES (damurdock's mod)[https://github.com/damurdock/Teensyduino-PS-Button-Mod] to Teensyduino to work fully on a PS3 console.

If you don't care about that, you should comment out everything dealing with pin 10.

## Requirements

I built this for a Teensy LC. It uses pins 0-14 (the pins are labeled in the .ino) and a switch to change between DPad and Left Stick. 
Buttons should be connected to a ground and the pin.
